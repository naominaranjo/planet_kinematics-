### About
Our proposal is  a minigame/simulation in which the player can cutomize the mass and radius of their own planet and then explore the kinematic properties of this planet by seeing how objects behave on an incline and in projectile motion.

### How To Play 
#### Creation 
When the player first starts up the game, the will see the creation screen. On the right, the player and increase and decrease the mass and radius of the planet by pressing the corresponding + and - buttons, and the right they can see the planet that they are creating. Once the player is done making their planet, they can hit the 'Done' button and they will be taken to a page with instructions on how get to the Projectile Motion, Incline, and Information pages.
#### Projctile Motion
Once the user is done making their planet, they can press the 'P' key to reach the Projectile Motion page. Here the user can see how their changes to the planet effects projectile motion by launching balls from a cannon towards a target. The player can change the height and angle of the cannon as well as the initial velocity of the object.
#### Incline Plane
Once the user is done making their planet, they can also press the 'I' key to reach the Incline Plane page. Here the player can simulate an object falling down an incline plane, and can change the angle of the plane and the coefficent of friction between the object and the surface.
#### Information Page
The user can also see that stats (radius, mass and acceleration due to gravity) of their planet by pressing the 'W' key.
